# street_wise

A Flutter Application designed to make the streets much safer!

## Built With:

- in_app_notifications package for Flutter in app notifications. 

## Inspiration for Street-wise: 
The designer of the team, Tiffany, would always go hang out with her friends. However, her parents would tell her to notify them once she arrives at her destination. A majority of the time, Tiffany would forget to do so and her parents either would also forget or just assume that she got to her destination safely. Street-wise improves this quality of life by allowing parents to automatehow they protect their child. 

## What Street-wise Does: 

Makes going from place to place much more safe! People such as parents can create a tracker for their child. The adults can specify the name of the tracker, the location where the 
child is going to, and the amount of time before the child and the parents are notified. When the time is up, an SMS is sent to the child while the parent gets an in app
notification directly from the app. Parents can also see where their child is going to by using the Google Maps that is built into the application.
